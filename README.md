# Finis

Finis is a role-based construction operations mobile app built with Expo, React Native, Expo Router, and NativeWind.

The app currently covers three user experiences:
- Admin
- Worker
- Manager

It is focused on frontend workflows for project management, tasks, inventory, payroll, geofencing, chat, profile management, and quotation building.

## Why Finis Was Built
Finis was built to reduce day-to-day operational friction between office teams and field teams in construction work.

Construction teams often deal with disconnected workflows across projects, tasks, inventory, payroll, field communication, and quotations. Finis brings these workflows into one mobile app so each role can work from the same system with role-specific access and screens.

A major goal of the app is to make project coordination faster, reduce manual follow-up, improve visibility into field work, and help sales or management teams generate structured quotations more efficiently.

## Problems It Solves
Finis is intended to solve these business and workflow problems:
- project and company information being spread across different places
- admin, manager, and worker workflows being disconnected
- task assignment and tracking being too manual
- inventory stock updates not being reflected quickly
- payroll scheduling and summary flow being fragmented
- field documents and activity records not being centrally accessible
- quotation generation taking too much time
- service pricing and work item selection not being standardized
- client-facing quote output being inconsistent
- role-specific users not having a focused workflow inside one app

## Current Scope
This repository is primarily frontend-focused.

Some modules already behave like backend-ready flows, but many business workflows still use mock data.

Examples:
- manager quotes use combination-based mock catalogs
- task, team, and inventory screens include local interactive state
- role selection is currently development-only

## Role Experiences
### Admin
Admin can access:
- Home dashboard
- Company tab
- Chat tab
- Payroll tab
- Inventory tab
- Company profile and project flows
- Assigned projects
- Project details, project analysis, team, task, and documents
- Create and edit project flows
- Floor and room setup
- Geofencing
- Payroll summary and pay stub
- Admin profile and settings-style flows

Admin tab layout lives in:
- `app/(tab)/_layout.tsx`

### Worker
Worker can access:
- Home
- Tasks
- Chat
- Profile
- Worker support/settings/legal screens
- View task
- Worker task details

Worker tab layout lives in:
- `app/worker/_layout.tsx`

### Manager
Manager can access:
- Home
- Projects
- Tasks
- Inventory
- Chat
- Quotes

Manager tab layout lives in:
- `app/manager/_layout.tsx`

## Quotes Module
The manager quotes module is one of the main structured flows in the app.

### Step Flow
1. Client information and project setup
2. Service selection from a dynamic catalog
3. Final review with discount, PDF, and email actions

### Supported Combinations
The quote flow currently supports these exact combinations:
- New Build - Residential - House
- New Build - Residential - Apartment
- New Build - Commercial - House
- New Build - Commercial - Apartment
- Renovations - Residential - House
- Renovations - Residential - Apartment
- Renovations - Commercial - House
- Renovations - Commercial - Apartment

### Current Quote Behavior
- project type, property type, and unit type are selected separately
- step 2 loads a catalog from a backend-like mock structure
- quantity and unit of measurement are separate
- item subtotal is based on quantity × selected unit price
- custom items can be added manually
- final review supports discount
- quote PDF can be generated
- quote email action can be triggered

## App Entry Flow
Current app entry flow:
1. `app/index.tsx`
2. splash image screen
3. redirect to `/screens/auth/privacy`
4. auth-related screens
5. development role selector
6. role-based navigation shell

## Development Role Selection
The screen:
- `app/screens/auth/roleselect.tsx`

is currently used for development and manual UI testing.

Once backend-based authentication and role assignment are connected, the app can skip this screen and route directly to the correct role layout.

## Local Setup and Connection

This mobile app connects to the NestJS API in the sibling `finis-backend`
folder. Subscription plan and shared project/company links open the React
dashboard in the sibling `finis-dashboard` folder.

### Requirements

- Node.js 20 or 22
- pnpm
- JDK 17 and Android Studio/Android SDK for Android native builds
- Xcode on macOS for iOS native builds
- A running backend and PostgreSQL database for real API data

### Install

From this folder:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/project/finis/finis
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
```

If VS Code was installed through Snap and pnpm reports
`ERR_PNPM_UNEXPECTED_STORE`, use the existing store explicitly:

```bash
pnpm --store-dir /home/alif/.local/share/pnpm/store/v11 install
```

### Environment variables

For an Android emulator, use:

```dotenv
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:6000
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL_PLAN=http://10.0.2.2:5173
EXPO_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_URL=http://10.0.2.2:5173
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key
```

For a physical phone, replace `192.168.1.10` below with the computer's LAN
IP. The phone and computer must be on the same network.

```dotenv
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.10:6000
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL_PLAN=http://192.168.1.10:5173
EXPO_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_URL=http://192.168.1.10:5173
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key
```

Find the computer's LAN IP on Ubuntu with:

```bash
hostname -I
```

For a remote device, use public HTTPS URLs instead of LAN URLs. Do not add a
trailing slash to the base URLs.

### Run the app

Start the backend and dashboard first, then run one of these commands:

```bash
pnpm start
pnpm android
pnpm web
```

For an existing native Android project, `pnpm android` builds and installs the
debug app. If only Metro is needed, run `pnpm start` and press `a`.

After changing `.env`, stop Metro and restart it with a cleared cache:

```bash
pnpm exec expo start --clear
```

### Native Android generation and release build

Regenerate native files after changing native Expo configuration:

```bash
pnpm exec expo prebuild --platform android
```

Build the release APK:

```bash
cd android
NODE_ENV=production ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The APK is written to:

```text
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

Firebase native builds also require `google-services.json` in this folder.
For iOS, `GoogleService-Info.plist` is required.

### Checks

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
```

## Build / Asset Notes
- App configuration is managed in `app.json`
- Main app icon is in `assets/images/icon.png`
- Splash-related image is in `assets/images/splash-icon.png`
- After changing launcher icon assets, rebuild the app to see the updated launcher icon

## Known Limitations
Current limitations in the repo:
- several modules still use mock data
- role routing is development-oriented, not backend-auth-driven
- some flows are UI-complete but not API-complete
- manager quotes are catalog-driven locally, not from a real backend yet
- some business rules are represented as frontend assumptions for now

## Backend-Ready Areas
These parts are already structured so backend integration is easier later:
- manager quotes catalog selection
- role-based navigation separation
- inventory update flow
- task status updates
- profile avatar update flow

## Suggested Next Backend Integrations
Recommended backend work order:
1. auth + role assignment
2. quotes catalog API
3. project and task APIs
4. inventory stock API
5. payroll data API
6. chat backend / realtime messaging

## Notes for Contributors
- Keep role-based flows isolated by route layout
- Prefer reusing components instead of duplicating whole screens
- Keep data-driven structures in modules like quotes and inventory so backend integration stays clean
- When changing app icon or some native package behavior, rebuild the app instead of relying only on hot reload
